# Template Restoration Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Templates**: Restored all 16 templates that were reduced to only 7
2. **Artifacts Plugin Error**: Removed the incorrect `artifacts` plugin configuration that was causing validation errors

## Templates Restored

The following 16 templates are now available:

### Testing Templates
1. **Unit Tests** - Jest Coverage (`node-app`)
2. **Integration Tests** - Cypress E2E (`mobile-app`)
3. **Parallel Tests** - Parallel Performance (`multi-platform`)
4. **Security Scan** - Security SAST (`security-scan`)

### Build & Package Templates
1. **Node.js Build** - Node NPM (`node-app`)
2. **Python Build** - Python Pip (`python-ml`)
3. **Go Build** - Go Binary (part of `multi-platform`)
4. **Multi-Arch Build** - ARM64 AMD64 (`multi-platform`)

### Deployment Templates
1. **Kubernetes Deploy** - K8s Helm (`k8s-deploy`)
2. **AWS Deploy** - ECS Lambda (`serverless`)
3. **GCP Deploy** - GKE Cloud Run (`k8s-deploy`)
4. **Static Site Deploy** - CDN S3 (part of `release`)

### Docker Templates
1. **Docker Build** - Docker Build (`docker-microservice`)
2. **Docker Compose** - Compose Multi-Container (`docker-microservice`)
3. **Docker Push** - Registry ECR (`docker-microservice`)
4. **Docker Scan** - Security Trivy (`security-scan`)

### Additional Templates
- **Terraform Infrastructure** - Infrastructure as Code pipeline
- **Monorepo Pipeline** - Intelligent monorepo with change detection
- **Data Pipeline** - ETL with validation and quality checks
- **Compliance Pipeline** - Automated compliance and audit trails
- **Performance Testing** - Load testing and benchmarks
- **Release Pipeline** - Automated versioning and distribution

## Key Changes

1. **Fixed Plugin References**: The `artifacts` plugin was incorrectly referenced. This has been removed from templates where it was causing issues. Artifact handling is done through the `artifact_paths` property instead.

2. **Proper Plugin Naming**: When plugins are needed, they use the full plugin name with version (e.g., `docker-buildkite-plugin#v3.0.0`)

3. **Comprehensive Templates**: Each template now includes a complete pipeline configuration with multiple steps, proper dependencies, and real-world patterns.

## Testing

Use the `test-template-yaml.html` file to:
- Test individual templates
- Validate YAML generation
- Check for common errors

All templates have been verified to generate valid Buildkite YAML.
