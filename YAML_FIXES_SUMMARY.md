# YAML Generation Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Group Steps with Keys
**Problem**: Group steps were being generated with `key` attributes at the step level, which is invalid in Buildkite.
```yaml
# BEFORE (Invalid)
- group: Test Suite
  key: test_group  # ❌ Invalid - group steps don't support step-level keys

# AFTER (Valid)
- group: Test Suite
  # key attribute removed for group steps
```

### 2. Soft Fail Object Handling
**Problem**: When `soft_fail` was an object with `exit_status`, it was being serialized as "[object Object]".
```yaml
# BEFORE (Invalid)
soft_fail: "[object Object]"  # ❌ Invalid

# AFTER (Valid)
soft_fail:
  exit_status:
    - 1
    - 2
```

### 3. Key Naming Convention
**Problem**: Keys were using hyphens (e.g., `build-1`) which is invalid. Buildkite keys must only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.
```yaml
# BEFORE (Invalid)
key: build-1  # ❌ Invalid - contains hyphen

# AFTER (Valid)  
key: build_1  # ✅ Valid - uses underscore
```

### 4. Block and Input Steps
**Confirmed**: Block and input steps correctly don't include `key` attributes at the step level (only on their fields).

## Files Modified

1. **js/yaml-generator.js**
   - Enhanced soft_fail handling to properly format object types with exit_status
   
2. **js/pipeline-builder.js**
   - Removed "Group Key" input field from group step form
   - Removed key listener from setupGroupStepListeners
   - Added note that group steps don't support step-level keys

3. **js/pipeline-templates-enhanced.js**
   - Changed `build-artifact` → `build_artifact`
   - Changed `build-services` → `build_services`

4. **js/pipeline-templates.js**
   - Changed `build-packages` → `build_packages`

5. **js/pipeline-patterns.js**
   - Changed `build-service-a` → `build_service_a`
   - Changed `build-service-b` → `build_service_b`
   - Changed `build-service-c` → `build_service_c`

6. **Test files** (debug-yaml.html, test-yaml-output.html, test-exact-yaml.html)
   - Updated all test cases to use underscores instead of hyphens in keys

## Testing

Created `test-yaml-fixes.html` to verify:
- Group steps generate without keys
- Soft fail objects are properly formatted
- Block and input steps don't include step-level keys
- All keys use underscores instead of hyphens

## Result

The YAML generation now produces valid Buildkite pipeline configurations that should not trigger the "`key` is invalid: configuration must be defined with an object" error.
